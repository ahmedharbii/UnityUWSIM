# UnityUWSIM
The Underwater Simulator, developed using Unity, served as the simulator for the MIR Competition held at [Universitat Jaume I (UJI)](https://www.uji.es/) in the [Marine & Maritime Intelligent Robotics (MIR) Erasmus Masters](https://www.master-mir.eu/) program in 2023.  

Link to the competition: [2nd MIR Annual Symposium Robotics Challenge – UJI, Spain, June 20-23, 2023](https://www.master-mir.eu/2nd-mir-annual-symposium-robotics-challenge-uji-spain-june-20-23-2023/)

The simulation environment is based on the CIRTESU Lab.

## Case Scenarios:

### Visual Servoing using Unity and BlueROV2 - Docking Station:

[![Alt text](https://img.youtube.com/vi/v4bm29MwCQ8/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4bm29MwCQ8)



The environment has 4 main parts:
1. Docking Station
2. Big Rock in the middle of the pool
3. Humpback whales
4. BlueROV2

Missions:
1. Obstacle avoidance with the Rock and the whales.
2. Safely maneuver and go to the docking station.
